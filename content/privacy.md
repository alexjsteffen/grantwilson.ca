### Your Rights

In this Section, we have summarized the rights that you have under data  protection law. Some of the rights are complex, and not all of the  details have been included in our summaries. Accordingly, you should  read the relevant laws and guidance from the regulatory authorities for a full explanation of these rights.

Your principal rights under data protection law are:

1. the right to access;
2. the right to rectification;
3. the right to erasure;
4. the right to restrict processing;
5. the right to object to processing;
6. the right to data portability;
7. the right to complain to a supervisory authority; and,
8. the right to withdraw consent.
9. You have the right to confirm as to whether we process your personal data  and, where we do, access to the personal data, together with certain  additional information. That additional information includes details of  the purposes of the processing, the categories of personal data  concerned and the recipients of the personal data. Providing the rights  and freedoms of others are not affected, we will supply to you a copy of your personal data. The first copy will be provided free of charge, but additional copies may be subject to a reasonable fee.
10. You have the right to have any inaccurate personal data about you rectified and, considering the purposes of the processing, to have any incomplete personal data about you completed.
11. In some circumstances you have the right to the erasure of your personal data without undue delay. Those circumstances include:
12. The personal data are no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for  which they were collected or otherwise processed; you withdraw consent  to consent-based processing; you object to the processing under certain  rules of applicable data protection law; the processing is for direct  marketing purposes; and the personal data have been unlawfully  processed.
13. However, there are exclusions of the right to erasure. The general exclusions include where processing is necessary:
14. For exercising the right of freedom of expression and information
15. For compliance with a legal obligation; or,
16. For the establishment, exercise, or defence of legal claims.
17. In some circumstances you have the right to restrict the processing of your personal data. Those circumstances are:
18. You contest the accuracy of the personal data;
19. Processing is unlawful, but you oppose erasure; we no longer need the personal  data for the purposes of our processing, but you require personal data  for the establishment, exercise, or defence of legal claims; and,
20. You have objected to processing, pending the verification of that objection.

Where processing has been restricted on this basis, we may continue to store  your personal data. However, we will only otherwise process it: with  your consent; for the establishment, exercise, or defence of legal  claims; for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal  person; or for reasons of important public interest.

#### Objections and other rights

You have the right to object to our processing of your personal data on  grounds relating to your situation, but only to the extent that the  legal basis for the processing is that the processing is necessary for:  the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the  exercise of any official authority vested in us; or the purposes of the  legitimate interests pursued by us or by a third party. If you make such an objection, we will cease to process the personal information unless  we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing  which override your interests, rights and freedoms, or the processing is for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.

You have the right to object to our processing of your personal data for  direct marketing purposes (including profiling for direct marketing  purposes) towards you. If you make such an objection, we will cease to  process your personal data for this purpose. However, if this objection  impedes the quality of our services for you, you understand and agree  that our service effectiveness will be impeded, and you may have to  cease using our service.

You have the right to object to our processing of your personal data for  scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes on  grounds relating to your situation, unless the processing is necessary  for the performance of a task carried out for reasons of public  interest.

#### Legal Basis for processing

To the extent that the legal basis for our processing of your personal data is:

1. Consent; or,
2. that the processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which  you are party or to take steps at your request prior to entering into a  contract, and such processing is carried out by automated means, you  have the right to receive your personal data from us in a structured,  commonly used and machine-readable format. However, this right does not  apply where it would adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others.

If you consider that our processing of your personal information infringes data protection laws, you have a legal right to lodge a complaint with  relevant supervisory authority responsible for data protection.  Specifically:

1. If you are a resident of Canada, you may file a complaint with the *Canadian Office of the Privacy Commissioner* or any other relevant Federal or Provincial body;
2. If you are a resident of the United States, you may file a complaint with the *Federal Trade Commission (FTC)* or any other relevant Federal or State body; or,
3. If you are a resident of the European Union or European Economic Area, you may do so in the EU/EEA member state of your habitual residence, your  place of work or the place of the alleged infringement.
4. To the extent that the legal basis for our processing of your personal  information is consent, you have the right to withdraw that consent at  any time. Withdrawal will not affect the lawfulness of processing before the withdrawal.

You may exercise any of your rights in relation to your personal data by written notice to us.
